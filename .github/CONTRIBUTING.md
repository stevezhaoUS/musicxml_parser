## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
- `lib/src/models/` - Data model classes
- `lib/src/parser/` - Parsing logic
- `lib/src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `lib/src/exceptions/` - Custom exceptions
- `test/` - All test files (mirror lib structure)

### Coding Standards
- Use `@immutable` for model classes where appropriate
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- Follow Dart's official style guide

### Testing Requirements
- Every public method must have tests
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests logically
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Music Theory Accuracy
When implementing music-related features:
- Validate against music theory rules
- Ensure MIDI note ranges are correct (0-127)
- Follow standard notation conventions
- Reference authoritative music theory sources

### Documentation
- Use dartdoc format for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Explain music theory concepts when relevant
- Update relevant documentation files
