## Testing Coverage

| Category | Coverage | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Basic parsing | ✅ | Comprehensive tests |
| Note parsing | ✅ | All basic note types |
| Time signatures | ✅ | Common time signatures |
| Key signatures | ✅ | All standard keys |
| Multi-part scores | 🚧 | Basic tests, needs expansion |
| Error handling | 🚧 | Basic tests, needs expansion |
| Edge cases | ⏳ | Planned comprehensive testing |

## Known Limitations

1. **Large files**: Performance not optimized for very large scores (>1000 measures)
2. **Memory usage**: No streaming parser for large files yet
3. **Validation**: Limited musical validation of parsed content
4. **Cross-references**: Tie and slur references not fully resolved
5. **Layout**: No layout or formatting information preserved
